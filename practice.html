    <h1 style="color: red; font-size: small;"><u>ABOUT GWALIOR</u></h1>
    <p class="b"> gwalior is a major city in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh; it lies in northern part of
        Madhya
        Pradesh and is one of the Counter-magnet cities. Located 343 kilometres (213 mi) south of Delhi, the capital
        city of India, 120 kilometres (75 mi) from Agra and 414 kilometres (257 mi) from Bhopal, the state capital,
        Gwalior occupies a strategic location in the Gird region of India. The historic city and its fortress have been
        ruled by several historic Indian kingdoms. From the Kachchhapaghatas in the 10th century, Tomars in the 13th
        century, it was passed on to the Mughal Empire, then to the Maratha in 1754, and the Scindia Dynasty of Maratha
        Empire in the 18th century.[5] In April 2021, It was found that Gwalior had the best air quality index (AQI 152)
        amongst the 4 major cities in Madhya Pradesh.

        Besides being the administrative headquarters of Gwalior district and Gwalior division, Gwalior has many
        administrative offices of the Chambal division of northern Madhya Pradesh. Several administrative and judicial
        organisations, commissions and boards have their state and national headquarters situated in the city.

        Gwalior was the winter capital of the state of Madhya Bharat which later became a part of the larger state of
        Madhya Pradesh. Prior to Indian independence on 15 August 1947, Gwalior remained a princely state of the British
        Raj with the Scindia as the local rulers. High rocky hills surround the city from all sides, on the north it
        just forms the border of the Ganga- Yamuna Drainage Basin. The city however is situated in the valley between
        the hills. Gwalior's metropolitan area includes Gwalior city centre, Morar Cantonment,Lashkar Gwalior
        (Lashkar Subcity), Maharaj Bada, Phool Bagh, and Thatipur.</p>
    <h1 style="color: blue; font-size: small;"><u>Sas-Bahu Temple</u></h1>
    <p class="b">Sasbahu Temple, also called the Sas-Bahu Mandir, Sas-Bahu Temples, Sahasrabahu Temple or Harisadanam
        temple, is an 11th-century twin temple in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India.[2][3] Near the Gwalior Fort and
        dedicated to Vishnu in his Padmanabha form, like most Hindu and Jain temples in this region, it is mostly in
        ruins and was badly damaged from numerous invasions and Hindu-Muslim wars in the region.It was built in 1093
        by King Mahipala of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty, according to an inscription found in the larger of the twin
        temple. The twin temples are situated in the Gwalior Fort.The temple's tower and sanctum has been destroyed, but
        its architecture and damaged carvings can still be appreciated from the ruins. The jagati platform is 100 feet
        (30 m) long and 63 feet (19 m) wide, on a square plan.[2] The temple was three-storeyed, which was one of its
        distinguishing features and sophistication. It followed a central cluster concept, states Adam Hardy.The
        surviving elements of the temple are the entrance porch and the mandapa.[2] According to James Harle, though the
        prasada (tower, spire) no longer exists, the triple storey plan with a cruciform foundation and balconies
        suggests that it had a North Indian Bhumija style architecture. This style, states Harle, is marked by a well
        proportioned superstructure, its "regularly arranged little subordinate sikharas strung out like gigantic beaded
        garlands".</p>

        Birla. With its foundation stone laid on 19th January 1984, it took 4 years 4 days to complete its construction
        when finally on 23rd January 1988, the temple saw its completion. Initially known as Tapovan Garden, the name of
        the place changed to Surya Van or Surya Garden after completion. Inspired by the popular Sun Temple of Konark,
        Orissa, today this magnificent structure is equally revered in this ancient city.The Surya Mandir or Sun Temple
        is one of the most spectacular shrines as well as an architectural wonder that adorns the city of Gwalior. As
        the name suggests, the temple is dedicated to the holy Sun God and was constructed in the year 1988 by the
        famous industrialist G.D. Birla. Built on the lines of legendary Sun Temple at Konark, Orissa, the Sun Temple of
        Gwalior is a magnificent amalgam of exquisite architecture in red sandstone and pearly white marble.

        manner of gradual slots that reach up to the peak of the facade. A splendid idol of the Sun Lord is enshrined in
        the temple. Although not constructed long ago, it is among the most revered shrines in the ancient city
        attracting tourists and devotees from all over the country in large numbers. </p>
